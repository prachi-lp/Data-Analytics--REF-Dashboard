 # Research Excellence Framework (REF) Performance Dashboard – Tableau Project 
 
The Research Excellence Framework (REF) Performance Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project developed using Tableau. It analyzes institutional research performance using key metrics such as FTE Category A staff submissions, assessment units, performance percentages, and institutional rankings.

## Project objective 
- To analyze FTE Category A staff submissions across institutions
- To evaluate institutional rankings and sort order performance
- To assess overall research performance percentages
- To compare contributions across main panels (A, B, C, and D)
- To examine distribution of Units of Assessment
- To enable institutional benchmarking through interactive visualization
- To present complex research data in a clear and structured dashboard format

## Process
- Imported the Research Excellence Framework dataset into Tableau Desktop.
- Cleaned and prepared the data by verifying fields and creating necessary calculated measures.
- Developed key KPIs such as FTE submissions, performance percentage, assessment units, and institutional ranking.
- Designed an interactive dashboard with charts, panel comparisons, and filters for effective analysis and benchmarking.

  ## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total number of FTE Category A staff submitted across institutions?
- What is the overall aggregated performance percentage?
- How many total Units of Assessment are evaluated?
- Which institution ranks highest based on Sort Order?
- Which main panel (A, B, C, or D) contributes the most?
- How does FTE staff submission impact institutional ranking?
- Which institutions show the highest performance percentages?
- What is the distribution of assessment units across panels?

  ## Project Insights
- Certain panels contribute significantly more to total submissions.
- Institutions with higher FTE submissions often show stronger performance outcomes.
- Institutional rankings vary across panels.
- Performance distribution highlights dominant research categories.

  ## Conclusion
This dashboard effectively visualizes research performance metrics and enables institutional comparison through interactive analytics. It demonstrates strong skills in data preparation, calculated field creation, KPI development, and dashboard design in Tableau.
